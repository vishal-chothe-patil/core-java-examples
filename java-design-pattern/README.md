# Java Design Patterns Explained üéØ 

This project contains implementations and explanations of **commonly used design patterns** in Java. These patterns are crucial for building **robust**, **scalable**, and **maintainable** applications, especially in real-world domains like **FinTech, banking, and microservices**.

## What Are Design Patterns? 

**Design Patterns** are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide a **standard approach** to writing maintainable, scalable, and reusable code.

> Think of them as best practices and templates used by developers to solve recurring problems in software design.

## Why Use Design Patterns?

- Reusability of code and solutions  
- Loose coupling between components  
- Improved code **readability** and **maintainability**  
- Helps in designing **scalable** and **robust** systems  
- Industry-standard knowledge for interviews and clean architecture

## Types of Design Patterns üèóÔ∏è 

Design Patterns fall into **three main categories**:

| Category       | Description                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Creational     | Deals with object creation mechanisms         |
| Structural     | Deals with object composition                 |
| Behavioral     | Deals with object interaction and responsibility |
