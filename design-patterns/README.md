# Java Design Patterns Explained üéØ 

This project contains implementations and explanations of **commonly used design patterns** in Java. These patterns are crucial for building **robust**, **scalable**, and **maintainable** applications, especially in real-world domains like **FinTech, banking, and microservices**.

### üì¶ Included Patterns:
- Builder Pattern  
- Singleton Pattern  
- Factory Pattern  
- Prototype Pattern


## What Are Design Patterns? 

**Design Patterns** are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide a **standard approach** to writing maintainable, scalable, and reusable code.

> Think of them as best practices and templates used by developers to solve recurring problems in software design.

---

## Why Use Design Patterns?

- Reusability of code and solutions  
- Loose coupling between components  
- Improved code **readability** and **maintainability**  
- Helps in designing **scalable** and **robust** systems  
- Industry-standard knowledge for interviews and clean architecture

---

## Types of Design Patterns üèóÔ∏è 

Design Patterns fall into **three main categories**:

| Category       | Description                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Creational     | Deals with object creation mechanisms         |
| Structural     | Deals with object composition                 |
| Behavioral     | Deals with object interaction and responsibility |

## üîπ 1. Builder Pattern (Creational)

### What is the Builder Pattern?

The **Builder Pattern** is used to construct a complex object step-by-step. It separates the construction logic from the object‚Äôs representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### Why Use It?

- Handles complex objects with many optional fields
- Avoids telescoping constructors (too many parameters)
- Makes the code more readable and maintainable
- Useful for creating immutable objects with varying configurations

### Where It‚Äôs Used in FinTech?

- Loan applications with various fields (tenure, amount, documents, etc.)
- Complex reports or export requests (CSV, PDF)
- Insurance form builders, customer profile setup

---

### Example Usage (Java)

  ```java
   public class LoanApplicationBuilderPatternExaxmple {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          LoanApplication loan = new LoanApplication.Builder("Vishal Chothe", 50000)
                  .tenureMonths(24)
                  .interestRate(9.5)
                  .employmentType("Self-Employed")
                  .documentProof("PAN Card")
                  .build();
  
          System.out.println(loan);
      }
  }
  ```
---

## üîπ 2. Singleton Pattern

### What is the Singleton Pattern?

The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has **only one instance** throughout the application's lifecycle and provides a **global access point** to it. It is especially useful for managing **shared resources** like database connections, file handlers, or configuration managers.

---

### Why Use Singleton?

- Ensures a **single instance** of a class is created
- Saves memory and improves performance
- Provides **global, consistent access** to shared components
- Prevents issues caused by multiple instances (e.g., conflicting DB connections)

---

### Where It's Used in FinTech?

- **Database connection manager** (MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- **File logger** for auditing/reporting
- **Configuration loader** for secure credentials and environment variables

---

## Example 1: Singleton ‚Äì Database Connection

  ```java
  public class DatabaseConnection {
  
      // Static instance (shared)
      private static DatabaseConnection instance;
  
      // Private constructor to prevent external instantiation
      private DatabaseConnection() {
          System.out.println("Connected to FinTech DB");
      }
  
      // Thread-safe global access method
      public static synchronized DatabaseConnection getInstance() {
          if (instance == null) {
              instance = new DatabaseConnection(); // Created only once
          }
          return instance;
      }
  
      public void query(String sql) {
          System.out.println("Executing SQL: " + sql);
      }
  }
  ```
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage:
  ```java
  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          DatabaseConnection db1 = DatabaseConnection.getInstance();
          db1.query("SELECT * FROM loan_applications");
  
          DatabaseConnection db2 = DatabaseConnection.getInstance();
          db2.query("SELECT * FROM emi_payments");
  
          System.out.println("Same DB instance? " + (db1 == db2));  // true
      }
  }
  ```
---

### Example 2: Singleton ‚Äì File Logger

Conclusion: Singleton ensures a consistent, memory-efficient way to manage shared resources‚Äîmaking it ideal for core FinTech services like DB handling, logging, and configuration.

---

## üîπ 3. Factory Pattern

### What is the Factory Pattern?

The **Factory Pattern** provides a way to **create objects without exposing the instantiation logic** to the client. Instead of using `new` directly, the client calls a method (usually `getInstance()` or `create()`) which returns the appropriate subclass or implementation.

---

### Why Use Factory Pattern?

- **Encapsulates object creation logic**
- Promotes **loose coupling** between classes
- Makes code **extensible and flexible**
- Helps in managing **multiple implementations of a common interface**

---

### Where It's Used in Project?

- Selecting **payment gateways** (e.g., Razorpay, Stripe, PayPal)
- Choosing **loan evaluation strategies** (e.g., RiskBased, AutoApproved, Manual)
- Generating **different types of financial reports** (e.g., Monthly, Annual, Summary)

---


### Example: Factory Pattern ‚Äì Payment Gateway Integration

#### üîπ Step 1: Define Common Interface
  PaymentGateway ‚Üí common interface

#### üîπ Step 2: Implement Concrete Payment Providers
  Eg. RazorpayGateway, StripeGateway, PayPalGateway ‚Üí implementations

#### üîπ Step 3: Create the Factory Class
  PaymentGatewayFactory ‚Üí selects and returns the correct implementation based on input

#### üîπ Step 4: Use the Factory in Main Application
  Easy to add new gateways later without changing the core business logic.

Conclusion: The Factory Pattern simplifies payment provider integration. It enables dynamic selection of gateway logic and makes the code easier to maintain as new gateways (like PhonePe, Paytm) are added.

---

## üîπ 4. Prototype Pattern (Creational)

### üîç What is the Prototype Pattern?

The **Prototype Pattern** allows you to **clone existing objects** instead of creating new ones from scratch. It‚Äôs useful when object creation is **costly**, or when similar objects need to be created with slight variations.

---

### Why Use Prototype Pattern?

- Avoids expensive object creation  
- Supports cloning objects with different configurations  
- Helps in creating multiple similar objects quickly  
- Ideal when object initialization involves I/O, DB, or complex config

---

### Where It‚Äôs Used in FinTech?

- Cloning **loan document templates**
- Duplicating **financial contracts**
- Reusing **standard user onboarding forms**
- Generating **pre-filled reports**

---


### Example: Cloning a Loan Document Template

#### Step 1: Prototype Interface

  Defines a clone() method that all prototype-capable classes must implement.

  ```java
  public interface DocumentPrototype {
      DocumentPrototype clone();  // Clone method
  }
  ```
####  Step 2: Concrete Prototype Class

  Implements the clone() method to allow deep copying of a LoanDocument object.


#### Step 3: Client Code to Use Prototype

 Uses the clone() method to quickly create customized copies of loan documents for different customers.

---
###  Conclusion:
The Prototype Pattern is especially useful when you need to generate multiple documents or objects with the same structure but different values ‚Äî commonly seen in FinTech apps that manage forms, contracts, and batch operations.
