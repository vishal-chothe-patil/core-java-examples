# Core Java Fundamentals 😀👨‍💻

A comprehensive Core Java project showcasing fundamental concepts such as basic output programs, arithmetic operations using various data types, using user defined methods, user input handling, and object-oriented principles like class design and method overriding. 👨‍💻🎯

## ✅ What's Included:

✔️ **Basic Examples**: *(get started with Java syntax)*  
  - Simple programs demonstrating output and programs like `"Hello and welcome!"` to help understand basic structure (class, main method, and output).

✔️ **Arithmetic Operations**: *(get to Learn how arithmetic works with different data types, methods in Java)*  
  - Addition of Two Numbers, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division programs
    - Using different data types: `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `short`
  - Programs using methods: ✦ `With Return Type & With Parameters` ✦ `With Return Type & Without Parameters` ✦ `Without Return Type & With Parameters` ✦ `Without Return Type & Without Parameters`
  - Module Operator and Ternary Operator with few examples (like EvenOdd, MaxTwoNumber, VotingEligibility, Leap year, NumberCheck).
  - Each example includes: Variable declaration, Initialization, Arithmetic logic, Output statement displaying the result.

 ✔️ **Increment/Decrement Operators** 🔁

- Pre-increment (`++x`) & Post-increment (`x++`)  
- Pre-decrement (`--x`) & Post-decrement (`x--`)  
- Demonstrates differences in evaluation order  
- Real-time examples to visualize how these affect variable values

✔️ **Relational Operators** 🔎

- Comparison between variables using:  
    -  `<` , `>` , `<=` , `>=`  
  - Programs to evaluate conditions and return Boolean values
  - for control structures like `if`, `if-else ladder`, and `nested if.`
- **Less Than (`<`)**  
   - *Age Restriction*: Check if a user is too young to access specific content.  
   - *Stock Monitoring*: Alert if inventory falls below a minimum threshold.  
   - *Grading*: Determine if a score is below a passing grade.  
   - *Deadline Check*: Verify if a project completion date is before the due date.  
   - *Speed Violation*: Detect if a vehicle's speed is below the minimum limit for a highway.
     
- **Greater Than (`>`)**
  - *Performance Monitoring*: Trigger an alert if CPU usage exceeds 80%  
  - *Bank Balance Validation*: Check if a withdrawal amount exceeds the current balance  
  - *Attendance Check*: Ensure participants in an event exceed a required number  
  - *Scoring System*: Verify if a candidate's score surpasses a benchmark  
  - *Temperature Control*: Activate cooling if room temperature exceeds a set point
    
- **Less Than or Equal To (`<=`)**
  - *Discount Eligibility*: Offer discounts if total purchase amount is within a specific range  
  - *Loan Eligibility*: Approve loans if the applicant's age is less than or equal to 60  
  - *Queue Management*: Accept requests only if queue length is within limits  
  - *Task Scheduling*: Assign tasks with deadlines on or before the current date  
  - *Grade Assignment*: Assign "Pass" if a student's score is 40 or less

- **Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)**
  - *Eligibility Criteria*: Verify if a student qualifies for a scholarship based on marks  
  - *Stock Replenishment*: Trigger restocking if inventory is above reorder level  
  - *Promotion Check*: Promote employees with tenure greater than or equal to five years  
  - *Exam Cutoff*: Check if a candidate's score meets or exceeds the cutoff for selection  
  - *Fitness Tracking*: Record activity if steps walked exceed or equal a daily goal


✔️  **Equality Operators (`==`, `!=`) Use Cases**  

- **Equal To (`==`)**  
  - *Authentication*: Validate if entered username matches stored username.  
  -  *Feature Toggle*: Enable features if a specific setting matches "true".  
  - *Game Scoring*: Check if a player's score matches a winning target.  
  - *Status Check*: Determine if a system is in the "ready" state.  
  - *Configuration Validation*: Verify if the loaded configuration matches the expected setup.
    
- **Not Equal To (`!=`)**  
  -  *Error Detection*: Trigger an alert if `fileFormat != supportedFormat`  
  -  *User Privilege*: Restrict access if `userRole != "admin"`  
  -  *Data Synchronization*: Detect mismatches if `datasetA != datasetB`  
  -  *Device Status*: Notify if `deviceStatus != "online"`  
  -  *Process Validation*: Skip processes if `inputValue != defaultValue`  
 
✔️ **String Concatenation Operators** 🧵➕

- Combine and manipulate strings using:
  - `+` operator to join strings  
  - `+=` for appending  
  - Mixing strings with numbers and variables


✔️ **Commercial Scheme System Project**: *(commercialscheme-portal)*  
  - A basic Java console application to capture and display details, with Custom `Person` and `Address` classes with fields

✔️ **Product Review System Project** *(e-commerceProductReview)*
  - A basic Java console application to simulate an e-commerce-style product review system, with Custom `Product`, `User`, and `Review` classes with fields  
 
  - Demonstrates the use of:
    - `Scanner` class for taking user input  
    - Overridden `toString()` methods for clear and meaningful object output  
  - For understanding class relationships, object creation, user input handling, and simple usage in Java.
